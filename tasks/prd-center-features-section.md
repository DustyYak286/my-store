# PRD: Center "Features" Section on Scroll

## 1. Introduction/Overview

When a user clicks the "Features" link in the navbar or footer, the page scrolls to the "Why Choose Analenn?" section (also known as the Branding section). Currently, the scroll alignment is off, causing the top of the section to be hidden. This feature aims to correct the scroll behavior so that the "Features" section is vertically centered in the viewport after the smooth scroll animation completes.

## 2. Goals

- Ensure the "Features" section is correctly and pleasantly displayed to the user upon navigation.
- Implement a clean, CSS-first solution for smooth scrolling and centering.
- Maintain a consistent and smooth user experience for on-page navigation.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a user,** when I click the "Features" link in the navigation bar, I want the page to scroll smoothly to the "Features" section.
- **As a user,** when the scroll animation finishes, I want the "Features" section to be vertically centered in my browser window so I can view it without needing to manually adjust the scroll position.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  Clicking the "Features" link in the `Navbar` component shall trigger a smooth scroll animation.
2.  Clicking the "Features" link in the `Footer` component shall trigger a smooth scroll animation.
3.  When the scroll animation is complete, the `Branding` component (the "Features" section) must be vertically centered within the browser's viewport.
4.  The solution should prioritize using CSS for scrolling and alignment to ensure a clean and maintainable implementation.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- This feature will not involve complex JavaScript-based scroll position calculations unless a CSS-only approach proves insufficient.
- The design or content of the `Branding` section itself will not be changed.
- The behavior of other navigation links will not be altered.

## 6. Design Considerations

- The visual appearance of the `Branding` section should remain unchanged.
- The smooth scroll animation should feel natural and not be jarring to the user.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- The current implementation uses an `id="features"` on the `Branding` component. The solution will likely involve modifying the CSS related to this component and potentially the global CSS to enable smooth scrolling.
- The negative margins and `w-screen` class on the `Branding` component's container are the likely cause of the issue and may need to be adjusted or replaced with a different technique to achieve the full-width effect without interfering with scroll calculations.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Successful implementation will be measured by visually confirming that the "Features" section is vertically centered in the viewport after clicking the navigation links on multiple screen sizes.

## 9. Open Questions

- None at this time.
