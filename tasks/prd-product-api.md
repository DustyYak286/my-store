# Product Requirements Document: Product API

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a Product API for the e-commerce website. Currently, product information is hardcoded into the frontend, which is inflexible and difficult to manage. This feature will introduce a backend API to handle product data dynamically, enabling future scalability and easier content management. The initial focus will be on serving product data to the frontend, with the structure designed to support future administrative functionalities like adding or updating products.

## 2. Goals

- **Decouple Frontend from Data:** Separate the product data from the UI, allowing for independent updates.
- **Dynamic Content:** Enable the `ProductDetails` component to fetch and render product information from a centralized source.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Create a robust data structure and API that can be extended with new features (e.g., product variants, more detailed specifications) and administrative actions (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) in the future.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Establish a single, reliable source for all product-related information.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a developer,** I want to fetch product data from a consistent API endpoint so that I can build and maintain product display components without hardcoding data.
- **As a store administrator,** I want a system where product information can be updated in one place so that I can manage the product catalog efficiently without requiring code changes.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system shall provide a RESTful API endpoint (`/api/products`) to serve product data.
2.  The API shall support fetching a list of all products.
3.  The API shall support fetching a single product by its unique identifier (ID).
4.  The product data model must include the following fields:
    - `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `string` or `number`).
    - `name`: The product's title (e.g., `string`).
    - `description`: A detailed description of the product (e.g., `string`).
    - `price`: An object containing pricing details.
      - `original`: The base price (`number`).
      - `discount`: The discounted price (`number`, optional).
      - `currency`: The currency code (e.g., `"USD"`).
    - `image`: URL to the main product image (`string`).
    - `stock`: An object indicating availability.
      - `available`: A boolean indicating if the product is in stock.
      - `quantity`: The number of items in stock (`number`, optional).
    - `reviews`: An array of customer review objects.
      - `rating`: Star rating (e.g., `number` from 1 to 5).
      - `text`: The review content (`string`).
      - `author`: The name of the reviewer (`string`).
5.  The API design must be forward-compatible to allow for future implementation of `POST` (create), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` (remove) methods without requiring a structural overhaul.
6.  For the initial implementation, product data will be stored in and read from a local JSON file.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Implementation of the admin interface for creating, updating, or deleting products.
- User authentication or authorization for managing products.
- Database integration. This will be considered in a future iteration.
- The initial implementation will only focus on the `GET` (read) functionality.

## 6. Design Considerations

- The API response format must be JSON.
- API endpoints should follow RESTful conventions.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- The API will be implemented using Next.js API routes.
- Product data will be temporarily stored in a `data.js` file within the API route directory.

## 8. Success Metrics

- The `ProductDetails` component successfully fetches and renders product information from the `/api/products` endpoint.
- All hardcoded product data is removed from the `ProductDetails` component and any other frontend components.
- The API endpoint is stable, reachable, and returns data in the contractually defined structure.

## 9. Open Questions

- None at this time.
