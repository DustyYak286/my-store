# PRD: Simulated Checkout Flow

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a simulated checkout page. With the shopping cart fully functional, the next logical step is to create a checkout process to complete the core user journey. This feature will focus on creating the user interface and flow for collecting customer information and simulating an order placement, without integrating a real payment gateway.

## 2. Goals

- Create a functional and intuitive checkout UI where users can enter their information.
- Enable the "Checkout" button in the cart modal to navigate users to the checkout page.
- Simulate a complete order placement by validating the form, displaying a confirmation message, and clearing the cart.
- Provide a complete, end-to-end user experience from adding a product to the cart to "purchasing" it.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to proceed to checkout from my cart so I can finalize my purchase.
- **As a user,** I want to enter my contact, shipping, and billing information so the store knows who I am and where to send the product.
- **As a user,** I want to see a summary of my order on the checkout page to verify the items and total cost before placing the order.
- **As a user,** I want to place my order and receive a confirmation that it was successfully received.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  A new page shall be created at the `/checkout` route.
2.  The "Checkout" button in the `CartModal` component must be enabled and, when clicked, navigate the user to the `/checkout` page.
3.  The checkout page must display an **Order Summary** section showing the product name, quantity, and total price, pulling this data from the `CartContext`.
4.  The checkout page must include a form to collect the following information:
    - **Contact Information:** Email Address.
    - **Shipping Address:** Full Name, Street Address, City, Postal Code, Country.
    - **Billing Address:** With a checkbox or button to indicate "Same as shipping address" to auto-fill the fields.
5.  The "Place Order" button on the checkout page will trigger the following actions:
    - Perform basic client-side validation to ensure all required form fields are filled.
    - Upon successful validation, display a confirmation message (e.g., a toast notification saying "Thank you for your order!").
    - Clear all items from the shopping cart using the `clearCart` function from `CartContext`.
    - Redirect the user back to the homepage.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Integration with any real payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- User account creation, login, or authentication.
- Saving order history to a database or backend.
- Functionality for promo codes or discounts.
- Calculation of taxes or shipping costs.

## 6. Design Considerations

- The UI will adhere strictly to the existing design language of the application, including colors, fonts, spacing, and component styles (e.g., buttons, input fields).
- The layout will be responsive and ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- The checkout page will be implemented as a new Next.js page component.
- The page will consume data from the `CartContext` to display the order summary and to clear the cart upon successful order simulation.
- Form state will be managed using React's `useState` hook.

## 8. Success Metrics

- A user can successfully navigate from the cart modal to the `/checkout` page.
- The user can fill out all the fields in the checkout form.
- Clicking the "Place Order" button with valid data successfully triggers the confirmation message.
- The user's cart is empty after the simulated order is placed.
- The user is correctly redirected to the homepage after the process is complete.

## 9. Open Questions

- None at this time.
